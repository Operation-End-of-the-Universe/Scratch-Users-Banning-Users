# Scratch-Users-Banning-Users
Scratch Users may ban other users with this script, you need violent monkey and information about the user though. (User, email which can be found easily using appeals, and API)


# How-to-use
Install Violentmonkey: https://violentmonkey.github.io/
This will tampar the code and automaticallt run it.

Next, find the user you wish to ban
for example, i will use a alt accounts: @Gregorythemandios

Find email through appeals@scratch.mit.edu, email them saying that you forgot the email to that account. They will give you the email.

Then use a API/VPN Key, accessible by ProtoVPN (<-- Best option because it's free)

then enter those three things through the UI that will open up with this code and wait a few minutes as it will automatically find the password to the scratch user and then delete the account without a trace of you using it.

This UI is basically similar to a moderators UI Panel. 

BE WARNED: WE DO NOT CONDORSE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY (Banning scratch accounts aren't really illegal activity, but still), THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BAN DEMO THAT YOU MAY USE. WE AM LEGALLY NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCOUNT DATA BEING LOST
